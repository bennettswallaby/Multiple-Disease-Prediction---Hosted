Multiple Disease Prediction Webapp - Accuracy adjusted by correcting gini impurities by Machine learning.

Knowledge discovery of databases with an active research area promises a high payoff in a multitude of scientific applications. While performing a prediction model, splitting nodes of a decision tree plays an important aspect to determine how the features of the dataset will perform. Information gain and Gini index are rolled out so that split criteria can be more easily decided. In this paper we introduce a formal methodology to correct Gini impurity and imply it on a current existing model to check how we can perform better data corrections. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118565420/202842540-02a3dad3-4ebf-4a66-8628-219e68dea2cb.png)

A reduction of one of the propositions mentioned allows us to derive new algorithms for k-PMWGP with provable approximation factors. As an example, when ki is fixed, we can obtain a randomized PTAS for k-PMWGP with respect to the objective function. To do so, we run the randomize ed PTAS for the k-means problem proposed by Kumar et al. over instance V. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118565420/202842569-2475dc67-0843-41ae-aabd-a57def79cb5f.png)
