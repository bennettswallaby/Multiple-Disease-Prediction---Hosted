A reduction of one of the propositions mentioned allows us to derive new algorithms for k-PMWGP with provable approximation factors. As an example, when ki is fixed, we can obtain a randomized PTAS for k-PMWGP with respect to the objective function. To do so, we run the randomize ed PTAS for the k-means problem proposed by Kumar et al. over instance V. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118565420/202842569-2475dc67-0843-41ae-aabd-a57def79cb5f.png)
